      <strong>⏰ ACTION REQUIRED TODAY:</strong> Call all three leads between 7:00-8:30 AM (before they head to job sites) or during lunch (12:00-1:30 PM). All three are EXCELLENT prospects with zero web presence and strong reputations.
    </div>

    <h2>🏆 Top 3 Picks - Priority Ranking</h2>

    <!-- LEAD #1 -->
    <div class="lead-card gold">
      <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
        <span class="medal">🥇</span>
        <div style="flex: 1;">
          <h3 style="color: white; margin: 0;">Anytime Sewer & Drain Services</h3>
          <div class="score">9/10</div>
          <div style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;">
            <div class="phone">☎️ +1 860-286-0331</div>
            <div class="rating">⭐ 4.8 stars (92 reviews) | Category: Plumber</div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Why They're #1:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Highest social proof:</strong> 92 reviews = very established business</li>
      <li><strong>Excellent reputation:</strong> 4.8 stars = they deliver quality service</li>
      <li><strong>Emergency service:</strong> People search for plumbers at 2 AM - they're invisible online</li>
      <li><strong>Immediate ROI potential:</strong> Every emergency search they miss = lost revenue</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>📞 Opening Script:</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
      "Hi, is this Anytime Sewer & Drain Services? My name is [Your Name]. I was researching plumbers in the 06002 area and noticed something interesting - you have 92 Google reviews and a 4.8-star rating, which is incredible! But when I searched for 'emergency plumber near 06002,' your company didn't come up in the results because you don't have a website. That means you're losing every single person who searches online - probably 80-90% of new customers. I specialize in simple, effective websites for contractors. Would you be interested in a 10-minute conversation about how we could get you more leads?"
    </div>

    <h3>🎯 Key Talking Points:</h3>
    <div class="key-point">
      <strong>Hook:</strong> "How many customers did you lose last month because they couldn't find you on Google?"
      <ul>
        <li>Emergency plumbing = high-intent searches happening 24/7</li>
        <li>Simple landing page with click-to-call = immediate ROI</li>
        <li>Their 4.8 rating should be showcased to build instant trust</li>
        <li>They're losing EVERY online lead to competitors</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>⏰ Best Contact Times:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>TODAY 7:00-8:30 AM</strong> (before they head out to jobs) ⬅️ <strong>CALL NOW</strong></li>
      <li>4:30-6:00 PM (after work hours)</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> 9 AM - 4 PM (on job sites)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><span class="check">✅ NO RED FLAGS</span> - Perfect prospect!</p>

        <span class="medal">🥈</span>
        <div style="flex: 1;">
          <h3 style="color: white; margin: 0;">Venora Electric Inc</h3>
          <div class="score">8.5/10</div>
          <div style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;">
            <div class="phone">☎️ +1 860-242-8081</div>
            <div class="rating">⭐ 4.7 stars (58 reviews) | Category: Electrician</div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Why They're #2:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Strong reputation:</strong> 4.7 stars, 58 reviews = quality work</li>
      <li><strong>Commercial opportunity:</strong> Business clients EXPECT professional web presence</li>
      <li><strong>Project-based work:</strong> Homeowners research and compare electricians online</li>
      <li><strong>Emergency + planned work:</strong> Website captures both types of leads</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>📞 Opening Script:</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
      "Good morning! Is this Venora Electric? My name is [Your Name]. I came across your company - 4.7 stars with 58 reviews is really impressive! But I noticed you don't have a website. When someone's planning a renovation or panel upgrade, they're comparing electricians online. If they can't find information about your company or see photos of your work, they're calling someone else. I build websites specifically for electrical contractors. Do you have 10 minutes this week to discuss how this could help you win more jobs?"
    </div>

    <h3>🎯 Key Talking Points:</h3>
    <div class="key-point">
      <strong>Hook:</strong> "When was the last time a commercial client asked for your website before hiring?"
      <ul>
        <li>Commercial clients expect professional online presence for vetting</li>
        <li>Website with project gallery = instant credibility boost</li>
        <li>Home renovation leads have longer research cycles = more comparison shopping</li>
        <li>58 reviews should be showcased prominently</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>⏰ Best Contact Times:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>TODAY 7:00-8:30 AM</strong> (before first job) ⬅️ <strong>CALL TODAY</strong></li>

    <!-- LEAD #3 -->
    <div class="lead-card bronze">
      <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
        <span class="medal">🥉</span>
        <div style="flex: 1;">
          <h3 style="color: white; margin: 0;">John's Plumbing & Heating LLC</h3>
          <div class="score">7.5/10</div>
          <div style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;">
            <div class="phone">☎️ +1 860-242-4909</div>
            <div class="rating">⭐ 4.3 stars (41 reviews) | Category: Plumbing & Heating</div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Why They're #3:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dual services:</strong> Plumbing + HVAC = MORE reasons for website</li>
      <li><strong>Seasonal opportunity:</strong> HVAC is seasonal - website captures off-season planning leads</li>
      <li><strong>Recurring revenue potential:</strong> Maintenance contracts easier to sell online</li>
      <li><strong>Educational content opportunity:</strong> Can establish authority with helpful articles</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>📞 Opening Script:</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
      "Hi, this is [Your Name] calling for John's Plumbing & Heating. I noticed you handle both plumbing and HVAC services - that's a great combination! But you don't have a website, which means you're missing out on twice as many opportunities. When someone's furnace dies or they need a plumber fast, they're searching Google. If you don't show up, you're not getting the call. With two service lines, you're losing DOUBLE the online leads. Would you be open to a brief conversation about fixing that?"
    </div>

    <h3>🎯 Key Talking Points:</h3>
    <div class="key-point">
      <strong>Hook:</strong> "How much business do you think you're losing to competitors who show up on Google?"
      <ul>
        <li>Double services = double the missed opportunities</li>
        <li>Seasonal HVAC leads (furnace installs in summer, AC in winter)</li>
        <li>Maintenance contracts = recurring revenue via online signup</li>
        <li>41 reviews prove quality work - let's showcase them</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>⏰ Best Contact Times:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>TODAY 12:00-1:30 PM</strong> (lunch break) ⬅️ <strong>CALL TODAY</strong></li>
      <li>6:30-8:00 AM (early morning)</li>
      <li>5:00-6:30 PM (after work hours)</li>
      <li><strong>Best Days:</strong> Monday or Tuesday</li>
    </ul>

    <p><span class="warning">⚠️ Minor concern:</span> Lower rating (4.3) - may be more price-sensitive. Focus on ROI and specific lead numbers.</p>

    <div class="key-point">
      <strong>They ALL have these pain points:</strong>
      <ul>

        <li>❌ Losing every "near me" Google search to competitors</li>
        <li>❌ Great reviews that nobody sees during their research</li>

        <li>✅ Professional online presence = win commercial contracts</li>
        <li>✅ 24/7 lead generation = phone rings even while they sleep</li>
        <li>✅ Simple, effective solution = no ongoing work required from them</li>

    <h2>📈 Expected Results</h2>

    <div class="key-point" style="background-color: #fef3c7; border-color: #f59e0b;">
      <strong>Conversion Forecast:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Expected close rate:</strong> 60-80% (2-3 out of 3 leads)</li>
        <li><strong>Why so high?</strong> All three have ZERO web presence, strong reputations, and clear need</li>
        <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Should book 1-2 discovery calls today, close 1+ within 7 days</li>
        <li><strong>Best first close:</strong> Anytime Sewer & Drain (highest pain, clearest ROI)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>💰 Pricing Strategy</h2>

    <div class="key-point">
      <strong>Don't lead with price - lead with VALUE:</strong>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Ask discovery questions:</strong> "How many leads do you get monthly? What's your average job value?"</li>
        <li><strong>Frame the investment:</strong> "If we brought you 2-3 extra jobs per month, what would that be worth?"</li>
        <li><strong>Then present pricing:</strong> Whatever you charge is a fraction of even ONE job they'll gain</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Their average job is probably $500-2,000. Website brings 2-3 jobs/month = $1,000-6,000 monthly value. Your price is a drop in the bucket.</p>

      <strong>Remember:</strong> These aren't cold leads - they NEED what you're selling. They just don't know it yet.<br>
      Your job is to show them the money they're leaving on the table every single day.

People want to see credentials, \npast work, and reviews before they let someone into their home or business.\n\nWe build websites specifically for contractors that showcase your expertise and \nturn visitors into paying customers. \n\nIs now a good time to talk about getting your business online? Takes about \n5 minutes.\"\n```\n\n**Best Time to Contact:** \n- **Tuesday-Thursday, 7:30-9:00 AM** (electricians start early)\n- **4:30-5:30 PM** (wrapping up day, back at shop/office)\n- **Avoid mid-morning through afternoon** (job sites)\n\n#### Email Template\n```\nSubject: Electrical customers want to see credentials online\n\nHi [Name],\n\nQuick question: When a homeowner needs an electrician, what do they check first?\n\nYour reviews (4.7 stars - great!)\nYour credentials and certifications\nPhotos of past work\nWhether you seem trustworthy\n\nRight now, Venora Electric has no website.

But what about when you want to hire another crew or expand? A website generates new customers while you sleep.\"\n\n**\"I'm not tech-savvy\"**  \n→ \"You don't need to be - we handle everything. You'll get a simple dashboard, or we can update it for you monthly.\"\n\n**\"Websites are expensive\"**  \n→ \"Think of it this way: If your website brings in just ONE extra job per month at $500, it pays for itself in 2-3 months. After that, it's pure profit.\"\n\n### Follow-Up Protocol\n- Day 1: Initial call\n- Day 2: Follow-up email with examples\n- Day 4: Second call attempt (different time)\n- Day 7: Final email with limited-time offer\n- Day 14: Archive or move to monthly nurture campaign\n\n---\n\n## 🚩 Key Success Factors\n\n✅ **All three have NO current website** - Not competing against existing site/designer loyalty  \n✅ **All have good-to-excellent reviews** - Established, reputable businesses  \n✅ **Emergency/trust-based services** - Highest ROI for website investment  \n✅ **Local service area** - All within target geography  \n\n**Expected Conversion Rate:** 33-50% (1-2 of these 3 should close with proper follow-up)\n\n---\n\n*End of Analysis*\n"}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","usage":{"input":10,"output":3812,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":9375,"totalTokens":13197,"cost":{"input":0.00003,"output":0.05718,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0.03515625,"total":0.09236625000000001}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771638658737}}

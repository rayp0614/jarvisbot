The key insights:\n\n1. **Taxes First LLC** - NO WEBSITE AT ALL - HIGHEST PRIORITY! This is a perfect lead for website development. They have good reviews (4.7 stars, 14 reviews) which means they have an active client base but no web presence.\n\n2. **Courtney, Fink & Forbes** - Has a very basic/outdated website that needs serious improvement. Good opportunity for website redesign and potentially AI automation for client scheduling/intake.\n\n3. **Bennett & Company** - This appears to be a data error (Texas firm, not Connecticut). Their website is already professional.

We'll launch before your busy season, so your website is working FOR you when you're slammed with clients. Plus, a website reduces interruptions by answering common questions automatically.\"\n\n### \"We get referrals, we don't need a website\"\n**Response:** \"Referrals are great! But even referred clients Google you first. What impression does no website (or an outdated site) give? A modern site validates the referral and makes them confident in choosing you.\"\n\n### \"How much does this cost?\"\n**Response:** \"For a professional website, we're looking at $2,500-4,000 one-time, plus $50-100/month for hosting and maintenance. If you land just 2 new clients from your website, it pays for itself. Most firms see 10-15 new inquiries in the first year.\"\n\n### \"I'll think about it\"\n**Response:** \"Absolutely! While you're thinking, I can send you a quick proposal showing exactly what we'd include and some examples of sites we've built for other accounting firms. Would that be helpful?

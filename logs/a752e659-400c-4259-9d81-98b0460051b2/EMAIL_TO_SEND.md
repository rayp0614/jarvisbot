      <div class="score">Conversion Score: 9/10</div>
      
      <p><strong>📞 Phone:</strong> <a href="tel:+18602428081">(860) 242-8081</a><br>
      <strong>📍 Address:</strong> 71 W Dudley Town Rd, Bloomfield, CT 06002<br>
      <strong>🌐 Current "Website":</strong> <a href="http://venoraelectric.com">venoraelectric.com</a> - <span style="color: #dc2626; font-weight: bold;">UNDER CONSTRUCTION PAGE ONLY!</span><br>
      <strong>⭐ Rating:</strong> 4.7 stars (58 reviews)<br>
      <strong>💼 Business Type:</strong> 24/7 Emergency Electrical Services</p>

      <h4 class="pro">✅ Why They're Perfect:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Already owns domain</strong> - Shows they understand web value but haven't executed</li>
        <li><strong>"Under Construction" for months/years</strong> - Clear pain point and frustration</li>
        <li><strong>24/7 emergency service</strong> - Needs website for after-hours lead generation</li>
        <li><strong>Excellent 4.7-star reputation</strong> - Deserves professional presence</li>
        <li><strong>Competitive market</strong> - Other electricians have working websites</li>
        <li><strong>High-value services</strong> - Electrical = high tickets = strong website ROI</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>💡 Key Talking Points:</h4>
      <div class="phone-script">
        "I noticed you have an incredible 4.7-star rating with 58 reviews - that's really impressive! I also saw your website shows 'Under Construction.' I'm guessing that's been on your to-do list for a while?<br><br>
        
        Since you're offering 24/7 emergency service, having a website that works around the clock to bring you leads is crucial. How many calls per week do you think you're missing because potential customers can't find information about your services online?"
      </div>

      <h4>🎯 Best Contact Time:</h4>
      <p><strong>Mon-Fri 8:00am - 10:00am</strong> (before field work starts) or <strong>2:00pm - 4:00pm</strong> (between jobs)</p>

      <h4>⚠️ Potential Objections:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>May have tried/failed with previous developer (abandoned site suggests this)</li>
        <li>Could be skeptical after bad experience</li>
        <li>Very busy with 24/7 service - hard to pin down</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>🛡️ Counter Strategy:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Acknowledge: "I know web projects can drag on forever..."</li>
        <li>Offer certainty: "7-10 days to launch, guaranteed"</li>
        <li>Make it easy: "I handle everything, you just review and approve"</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>💰 Recommended Pricing:</h4>
      <p><strong>$2,500 - $3,500</strong> (one-time) or <strong>$199/month for 18 months</strong><br>
      Includes: 5-7 pages, mobile responsive, SEO basics, contact forms, review integration<br>
      <em>Pitch: "Your domain is ready - let's finish what you started"</em></p>

    <!-- LEAD #2 - JOHN'S PLUMBING -->
    <div class="lead-card">
      <h3>#2 - JOHN'S PLUMBING & HEATING LLC</h3>
      <div class="score">Conversion Score: 7.5/10</div>
      
      <p><strong>📞 Phone:</strong> <a href="tel:+18602424909">(860) 242-4909</a> (main), (860) 904-5400 (alt)<br>
      <strong>📍 Address:</strong> 843 Blue Hills Ave, Bloomfield, CT 06002<br>
      <strong>🌐 Current Website:</strong> <span style="color: #dc2626; font-weight: bold;">NONE</span> (only directory listings)<br>
      <strong>⭐ Rating:</strong> 4.3 stars (41 reviews)<br>
      <strong>💼 Business Type:</strong> Plumbing & HVAC (heating, boilers, furnaces)</p>

      <h4 class="pro">✅ Why They Need You:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dual services (Plumbing + Heating)</strong> - Year-round business opportunities</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple phone numbers</strong> - Established operation</li>
        <li><strong>Physical storefront</strong> - Real business, not fly-by-night</li>
        <li><strong>Only on directory sites</strong> - Completely invisible in independent Google searches</li>
        <li><strong>Winter heating season</strong> - Losing emergency furnace calls RIGHT NOW</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>💡 Key Talking Points:</h4>
      <div class="phone-script">
        "I noticed you have a solid reputation with over 40 reviews, but when I search for 'plumbing and heating Bloomfield CT,' I only see you on directory sites competing alongside your competitors. With your own website, you'd show up separately AND showcase both services professionally.<br><br>
        
        This is especially critical during heating season - people with a broken furnace at 9pm are Googling 'emergency heating repair Bloomfield' and going with whoever has the best online presence."
      </div>

      <h4>🎯 Best Contact Time:</h4>
      <p><strong>Mon-Fri 9:00am - 11:00am</strong> (office hours) or <strong>Thu-Fri afternoons</strong> (planning mode)</p>

      <h4>⚠️ Potential Objections:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>May be old-school / resistant to technology (no web presence at all)</li>
        <li>Might think word-of-mouth is sufficient</li>
        <li>Lower rating (4.3) suggests possible service inconsistencies</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>🛡️ Counter Strategy:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Use competition: "Your competitors are getting these emergency calls instead"</li>
        <li>Create urgency: "Winter heating emergencies are happening now"</li>
        <li>Show ROI: "Just 2-3 extra jobs pays for the entire website"</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>💰 Recommended Pricing:</h4>
      <p><strong>$1,800 - $2,800</strong> (one-time) or <strong>$149/month for 24 months</strong><br>
      Includes: 4-6 pages, click-to-call, service area maps, basic SEO<br>
      <em>Pitch: "Stop losing emergency calls to competitors with websites"</em></p>

    <!-- LEAD #3 - ANYTIME SEWER -->

      <h3>#3 - ANYTIME SEWER & DRAIN SERVICES (Low Priority)</h3>
      <div class="score" style="color: #dc2626;">Conversion Score: 4/10</div>
      
      <p><strong>📞 Phone:</strong> <a href="tel:+18602860331">(860) 286-0331</a><br>
      <strong>📍 Address:</strong> 35 Peters Road Unit D, Bloomfield, CT 06002<br>
      <strong>🌐 Current Website:</strong> <a href="https://www.anytimesewerct.com/">anytimesewerct.com</a> - <span style="color: #059669; font-weight: bold;">FUNCTIONAL WIX SITE</span><br>
      <strong>⭐ Rating:</strong> 4.8 stars (92 reviews) - HIGHEST RATED<br>
      <strong>💼 Business Type:</strong> Sewer & Drain Specialists (since 1987)</p>

      <h4 class="con">❌ Why This Is Harder:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Already has functional website</strong> - Shows pricing, services, contact form</li>
        <li><strong>Professional online presence</strong> - Testimonials, clear service info</li>
        <li><strong>Long-established (1987)</strong> - Set in their ways, knows what works</li>
        <li><strong>Highest rated (4.8 stars)</strong> - Clearly successful without your help</li>
        <li><strong>Most reviews (92)</strong> - Steady stream of business already</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>💡 Possible Angle (Redesign/Upgrade):</h4>
      <div class="phone-script">
        "I saw your website and was impressed by your 4.8-star rating! I noticed you're on Wix, which works for basics. What I do is help established businesses upgrade to custom websites that convert visitors at much higher rates - things like better mobile experience, faster load times for SEO, online booking systems, and more prominent review displays.<br><br>
        
        Most companies see 30-40% increase in web-generated leads after upgrading from template platforms."
      </div>

      <h4>🎯 Best Contact Time:</h4>
      <p><strong>Tue-Thu 10:00am - 12:00pm</strong> (mid-week mornings)</p>

      <h4>⚠️ Why This Scores Low:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Already invested in web presence - hard to convince to switch</li>
        <li>Very successful - may not feel need to change</li>
        <li>Website actually works reasonably well</li>
        <li>This is a LONG-TERM nurture lead, not immediate conversion</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>💰 Recommended Approach:</h4>
      <p><strong>Email only for now</strong> - Plant seed for future conversation<br>
      If they express interest: $3,500 - $5,000 custom redesign<br>
      <em>Pitch: "Your 4.8-star reputation deserves better than a Wix template"</em></p>
    </div>

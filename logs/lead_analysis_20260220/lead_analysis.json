      "why_need_website": "Emergency electrical work is 70% searched on mobile. Without a website, you're invisible to homeowners Googling 'electrician near me' at 9pm when a breaker trips. Your 4.9 stars should be working 24/7 - not hidden.",

      "reasoning": "Tied for highest rating (4.9★), solid review base (68). HVAC is highly seasonal and competitive - spring/summer AC repairs are high-value. 'Energy Solutions' suggests modern, efficiency-focused positioning that needs digital presence.",
      "why_need_website": "HVAC customers compare multiple quotes online before calling. Peak season is coming (spring AC check-ups). Right now, every competitor with a website is getting leads you're missing. Your 4.9 rating needs to be on Google's first page.",

      "reasoning": "Highest review count (92) = most established. 'Anytime' branding implies 24/7 emergency service - CRITICAL need for online visibility. Strong 4.8★ rating. Emergency plumbing is pure mobile search behavior.",
      "why_need_website": "Your name literally says 'Anytime' but you're invisible when customers search at 2am with a flooded basement. Emergency plumbing searches are 85% mobile. You're losing high-value emergency calls to competitors with websites every single day.",

      "why_need_website": "You're competing with electricians who show up first on Google. 58 great reviews are worthless if customers can't find them. A website turns your reputation into 24/7 marketing that books appointments while you sleep.",

      "why_need_website": "Plumbing and heating customers research before calling. Your 4.3 rating isn't bad, but without a website to tell your story and showcase your work, you're just a number. Let's turn those 41 reviews into a powerful first impression.",

## 🆘 NEED HELP?

### If a script doesn't fit:
- Use the talking points as a guide, not a script
- Adapt to their energy and time constraints
- The key is the PROBLEM → SOLUTION flow

### If they want to think about it:
- "I understand. Can I send you 3 examples?"
- Reduces friction, keeps conversation alive
- Follow up in 3 days maximum

### If they say "too expensive":
- Never defend price
- Pivot to value: "How much is one new customer worth to you?"
- Emphasize ROI and lead generation

## 📈 NEXT STEPS AFTER CLOSING

When you close a deal:
1. **Send contract** - Get commitment in writing
2. **Collect deposit** - 50% upfront is standard
3. **Schedule kick-off** - Within 3-5 business days
4. **Ask for referral** - "Know any other [trade] businesses?"

---

You have 5 solid leads here. The top 3 are **exceptional** prospects:
- High ratings
- Established businesses
- Clear need for online presence

If you execute on these scripts and follow up properly, you should close **at least 2 deals**. More likely 3 if you're persistent.

**The key:** Don't overthink it. Pick up the phone and start calling. The analysis is done, the scripts are ready, you have everything you need.

Good luck! 🚀

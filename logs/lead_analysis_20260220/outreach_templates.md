## 🥇 RANK 1: Keno Electrical Systems LLC
**Phone**: +1 860-936-2043  
**Best Time**: Tue-Thu, 8:30-10:00 AM  
**Conversion Score**: 9.5/10

### Phone Script:
```
"Hi, this is [Your Name] with [Company]. I'm calling because I noticed 
Keno Electrical has an incredible 4.9-star rating on Google - that's 
impressive in your industry. 

The reason I'm reaching out is that when someone's breaker trips at 
9pm and they search 'electrician near me,' they can't find you because 
you don't have a website. You're losing those emergency calls to 
competitors who show up first on Google.

We specialize in simple, mobile-friendly websites for electricians that 
get you found on Google and let customers book 24/7. Most of our 
electrical clients see ROI within the first month.

Do you have 5 minutes to talk about how to capture those late-night 
emergency searches?"

[If yes]: "Great! Tell me - what percentage of your calls right now 
come from Google vs. word-of-mouth?"

[If no/busy]: "No problem - what's a better time to call back? 
Tomorrow morning around 9am?"
```

## 🥈 RANK 2: J.M. Curtis Energy Solutions
**Phone**: +1 860-264-5118  
**Best Time**: Mon-Wed, 4:00-5:30 PM  
**Conversion Score**: 9.2/10

### Phone Script:
```
"Hi, is this J.M. Curtis? This is [Your Name] with [Company]. I'll be 
brief - spring AC season is coming up, and I noticed Curtis Energy 
Solutions has a 4.9-star rating but no website.

Here's the problem: when homeowners search 'AC repair near me' or 
'HVAC contractor' to compare quotes, you don't show up. Every competitor 
with a website is getting those leads instead.

We build simple, effective websites for HVAC contractors that rank on 
Google and generate quote requests automatically. With spring approaching, 
this is the perfect time to get visible before peak season hits.

Are you open to a quick conversation about getting more leads for this 
summer?"

[If yes]: "Perfect. Tell me - do you currently get any leads from online 
searches, or is it mostly referrals?"

[If no]: "I understand you're busy heading into peak season. Can I send 
you a 2-minute email showing what we can do? What's your email?"
```

## 🥉 RANK 3: Anytime Sewer & Drain Services
**Phone**: +1 860-286-0331  
**Best Time**: Early morning 6:00-7:00 AM  
**Conversion Score**: 9.0/10

### Email Template:
**Subject**: Your "Anytime" service is invisible at 2am

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

I noticed Anytime Sewer & Drain has 92 reviews and a 4.8-star rating 
on Google - clearly you're the established choice for emergency plumbing 
in the area.

But there's a problem:

Your business name says "ANYTIME" but when someone's basement floods 
at 2am and they grab their phone to search "emergency plumber near me," 
they can't find you.

85% of emergency plumbing searches happen on mobile. Without a website, 
you're invisible to the most valuable customers - the ones who need 
help RIGHT NOW and will pay premium rates.

We build simple, mobile-first websites for emergency service businesses 
that:
- Show up when customers search at any hour
- Let them call you with one tap
- Display your 4.8-star rating front and center
- Generate leads while you're on another job

Most of our plumbing clients see ROI in the first month. Your 92 reviews 
should be working 24/7 to bring in high-value emergency calls.

Want to see a quick mockup of what this could look like for Anytime 
Sewer & Drain?

Reply "YES" and I'll have something to you by end of day.

## RANK 4: Venora Electric Inc
**Phone**: +1 860-242-8081  
**Best Time**: Tue/Thu, 2:00-3:30 PM  
**Conversion Score**: 8.0/10

### Phone Script:
```
"Hi, this is [Your Name] with [Company]. I'm reaching out because I 
noticed Venora Electric has 58 reviews and a solid 4.7-star rating, 
but you're missing out on a massive opportunity.

When people search for electricians on Google - and they do hundreds 
of times per day in your area - your competitors with websites show up 
first. You're invisible to those searchers.

We specialize in simple, affordable websites for electricians that get 
you on Google's first page. Think of it as a 24/7 salesperson that 
books appointments while you're working on other jobs.

Do you have a few minutes to discuss how to capture those searches?"

[If yes]: "Great! Quick question - what's your main source of new 
customers right now?"

[If hesitant about competition with Keno]: "I understand there's 
competition locally. But here's the thing - the market is big enough 
for multiple electricians, and right now you're letting ALL the online 
searches go to others. Let's capture your share."

## RANK 5: John's Plumbing & Heating LLC
**Phone**: +1 860-242-4909  
**Best Time**: Wed/Thu, 11:00 AM-12:30 PM  
**Conversion Score**: 7.5/10

### Email Template:
**Subject**: 41 reviews that aren't working for you

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

John's Plumbing & Heating has 41 Google reviews, which means you've 
been around and people trust you. But here's what's not working:

When someone needs a plumber or heating service, they search online 
first. They look at websites, compare reviews, and then call. Without 
a website, you're just a phone number - no story, no showcase of your 
work, no way to stand out.

Your 4.3-star rating is actually good (contrary to what you might 
think), but without a website to provide context - to show your 
expertise, your service area, your specialties - it's just a number.

We build affordable websites for plumbing and heating contractors that:
- Tell your story and build trust before the phone rings
- Showcase your best work with before/after photos
- Rank on Google for "plumber near me" and "heating repair"
- Let customers request quotes 24/7

The good news: you're in a dual-service business (plumbing + heating), 
which means you can capture leads year-round. Let's make sure those 
41 hard-earned reviews are actually working for you.

Interested in a quick 10-minute call this week?

## Follow-Up Strategy

### For all leads:
1. **First contact**: Use templates above
2. **Follow-up #1** (3 days later): "Just checking in - did you get my message about..."
3. **Follow-up #2** (1 week later): "I know you're busy. I'll make this simple - can I send you 3 examples of websites we've done for [similar business]?"
4. **Final follow-up** (2 weeks later): "Last time reaching out - if timing's not right, I understand. But your competitors ARE investing in websites right now. Let me know if you'd like to talk."

### Red Flag Handling:
- **"I'm too busy"**: "That's exactly WHY you need a website - to capture leads when you can't answer the phone."
- **"Websites are expensive"**: "Our starter package is [price] and most clients get ROI in the first month. Think of it as one extra job per month."
- **"I don't need a website"**: "How many customers do you think searched for [your service] today and called a competitor because they had a website?"
- **"I'll think about it"**: "Fair enough. Can I send you a quick case study showing what happened when [similar business] got their website?"

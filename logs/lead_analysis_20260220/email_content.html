Hi [Name],

I noticed Anytime Sewer & Drain has 92 reviews and a 4.8-star rating 
on Google - clearly you're the established choice for emergency plumbing 
in the area.

But there's a problem:

Your business name says "ANYTIME" but when someone's basement floods 
at 2am and they grab their phone to search "emergency plumber near me," 
they can't find you.

85% of emergency plumbing searches happen on mobile. Without a website, 
you're invisible to the most valuable customers - the ones who need 
help RIGHT NOW and will pay premium rates.

We build simple, mobile-first websites for emergency service businesses 
that:
- Show up when customers search at any hour
- Let them call you with one tap
- Display your 4.8-star rating front and center
- Generate leads while you're on another job

Most of our plumbing clients see ROI in the first month. Your 92 reviews 
should be working 24/7 to bring in high-value emergency calls.

Want to see a quick mockup of what this could look like for Anytime 
Sewer & Drain?

Reply "YES" and I'll have something to you by end of day.

[If hesitant about competition with Keno]: "I understand there's 
competition locally. But here's the thing - the market is big enough 
for multiple electricians, and right now you're letting ALL the online 
searches go to others. Let's capture your share."</div>
            
            <h4>Red Flags:</h4>
            <p class="red-flag">⚠ Slightly lower rating than competitor Keno - may need to emphasize differentiation</p>

Hi [Name],

John's Plumbing & Heating has 41 Google reviews, which means you've 
been around and people trust you. But here's what's not working:

When someone needs a plumber or heating service, they search online 
first. They look at websites, compare reviews, and then call. Without 
a website, you're just a phone number - no story, no showcase of your 
work, no way to stand out.

Your 4.3-star rating is actually good (contrary to what you might 
think), but without a website to provide context - to show your 
expertise, your service area, your specialties - it's just a number.

We build affordable websites for plumbing and heating contractors that:
- Tell your story and build trust before the phone rings
- Showcase your best work with before/after photos
- Rank on Google for "plumber near me" and "heating repair"
- Let customers request quotes 24/7

The good news: you're in a dual-service business (plumbing + heating), 
which means you can capture leads year-round. Let's make sure those 
41 hard-earned reviews are actually working for you.

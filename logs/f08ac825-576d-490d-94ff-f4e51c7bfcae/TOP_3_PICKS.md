"Hi, this is [Your Name] with [Company]. I was looking at local electricians and noticed Keno has incredible reviews - 4.9 stars! That's rare. 

I'm calling because businesses with ratings like yours should be dominating local search results. Right now, when someone's power goes out at midnight and they Google 'emergency electrician near me,' they're not finding you. They're finding your competitors who have websites.

We specialize in websites for contractors that turn those emergency searches into phone calls. Could we spend 15 minutes showing you what you're missing? We've helped electricians double their emergency call volume."

- **Score:** 9/10
- **Rating:** 4.9⭐ (68 reviews)

### Email Template:
**Subject:** J.M. Curtis deserves better than 4.9 stars being invisible online

Hi [Name],

I was researching top-rated HVAC contractors in the area and J.M. Curtis stood out - 4.9 stars is exceptional.

But here's the problem: When homeowners search "HVAC contractor near me" or "furnace replacement Bloomfield CT," you're invisible. All those perfect reviews aren't working for you because they're buried.

We build websites specifically for contractors that:
- Put your 4.9-star rating front and center
- Capture after-hours leads with instant quote forms
- Show up in Google Maps for local searches
- Cost less than one HVAC install

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see what you're leaving on the table?

Best,
[Your Name]
[Phone]

## 3. 🚰 ANYTIME SEWER & DRAIN - **CALL: 860-286-0331**
- **Score:** 8.5/10
- **Rating:** 4.8⭐ (92 reviews - HIGHEST VOLUME!)
- **Best Time:** Wednesday-Thursday, 3:00-5:00 PM
- **Hook:** "'Anytime' service but not findable online anytime? That's leaving money on the table..."

### Phone Script:
"Hi, calling for Anytime Sewer & Drain. Is the owner available?

[Once connected:]
I noticed you have 92 five-star reviews - that's more than almost any plumber in the area. Clearly you're doing something right.

But I have to ask - with 'Anytime' in your name, how many emergency calls are you losing at 11pm on a Saturday when people can't find you online? 

Every hour someone's basement is flooding, and if they can't find YOUR company with a simple Google search, they're calling whoever shows up first.

We build websites for plumbers that work 24/7 so you don't have to miss those $500-1000 emergency calls. Can we show you how in 15 minutes?"

## 🎯 CLOSING TIPS

1. **Lead with their reviews** - Everyone loves compliments
2. **Use the midnight scenario** - Emergency = urgency = emotion
3. **Do the math** - "2 missed calls/week × $400 = $3,200/month lost"
4. **Ask questions** - "How many calls do you think you miss after hours?"
5. **Keep it short** - "15 minutes" sounds less scary than "sales call"

**ROI Argument:** One extra job per month pays for the website. How many are they missing?

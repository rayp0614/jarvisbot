## 💡 Key Sales Angles (Use These!)

### 1. **The Midnight Scenario** (Works for all)
"When someone's [problem] happens at 2am and they Google '[service] near me,' who do they find? Not you. Your competitor with a website."

### 2. **The Math** (Overcome price objections)
"If you're missing just 2 calls per week at $400/call, that's $3,200/month in lost revenue. One extra job per month pays for the website."

### 3. **Review Leverage** (Hook opener)
"You have [X] stars with [Y] reviews - that's incredible! But all those reviews are doing NOTHING for you because customers can't find them when they search."

### 4. **Emergency = Urgency** (For contractors)
"Every hour you don't have a website, someone with a [emergency] is calling your competitor instead of you."

### 5. **Ask, Don't Tell** (Engagement)
"How many calls do you think you miss after hours each month? Even if it's just 3-4, that's $15K+ annually..."

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Red Flags to Watch:
- **Anytime Sewer**: High reviews but no website = may be older owner, less tech-savvy. Be patient, educate on value.
- **Venora Electric**: Mid-tier rating = may have budget constraints. Focus on growth/ROI.
- **John's Plumbing**: Lowest rating + small business = price-sensitive. Lead with affordability, not premium.

### Objection Handlers:
1. **"Too busy"** → "That means you're losing even MORE calls you can't answer"
2. **"Too expensive"** → "One job per month pays for it. How many are you missing?"
3. **"I get enough work"** → "What about next year? What about when you sell the business?"
4. **"I'm not tech-savvy"** → "That's exactly why we do this - you focus on [plumbing], we focus on websites"

## 📊 Success Metrics

If you close even ONE of the top 3:
- Keno or J.M. Curtis = $1,500-3,000 project (premium positioning)
- Anytime Sewer = $1,200-2,500 project (high volume, proven business)

Total potential: **$4,000-8,500** from just these 3 leads.
